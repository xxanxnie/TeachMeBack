Feature: Explore dashboard
  As a signed-in user
  I want to browse open skill exchange requests
  So I can find people to teach or learn with

  Background:
    Given the following users exist:
      | full_name     |

  Scenario: Guests do not see Explore in the nav
    When I visit the home page as a guest
    Then I should not see a link to the explore page

  Scenario: Guests are redirected if they visit /explore directly
    When I visit the explore page as a guest
    Then I should be on the home page
    And I should see "Please log in to access explore."
