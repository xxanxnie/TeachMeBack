## What We Accomplished (Iteration 1)
- Implemented the **Explore page** with dashboard features that display and filter skill exchange requests.  
- Built **access-control logic** redirecting logged-out users from protected pages to the login page.  
- Created the **signup and login flow** with `.edu` email validation to ensure only verified students can register.  
- Designed the **Skill Exchange Request model**, database migrations, and related controller actions for creating, listing, and viewing requests.  
- Set up **routes and navigation** between core pages (`/dashboard`, `/explore`, `/login`, `/signup`, `/requests`).  
- Added **Cucumber feature and RSpec tests** for access control, authentication, and dashboard/explore functionality.

## What We Accomplished (Iteration 2)
- Implemented a filtering system that lets users search for partners based on student/instructor role, skill category, and days they are available. These filters are processed in the backend through query parameters and ActiveRecord queries, and the UI supports toggle-style filtering and sorting options.
- Built the reciprocal matching logic. When one user sends a skill-exchange request to another, we store that request. If the second user sends a request back—whether for the same skill or a different one—we detect a mutual match, create a Match record, notify both users, and automatically create a chat channel.
- Implemented the messaging system so matched users can communicate. Each match spawns a Conversation model, and messages store the sender, content, and timestamp. We use ActionCable/WebSockets for real-time chat, and only the two matched users can access the conversation.
- With these features, we now have the full core loop: users can discover others, match, and chat after meeting.

## Final Iteration Enhancements
- Enhanced **text-based search** on the Explore page across skills and user names
- Expanded filtering with category-based constraints using `teach_category` and `learn_category`
- Updated the **matching algorithm** so users match only when teaching and learning preferences complement each other
- Added **profile enhancements**, including bio, location, and university fields
- Implemented the ability to **mark skill exchange requests as complete**
- Added a **review system** that allows users to leave feedback after completing an exchange

## Testing and Coverage
We tested application behavior using both RSpec and Cucumber.

- **RSpec Coverage:**  
  `coverage/rspec/index.html`  
  Line Coverage: **85.28% (423 / 496)**

- **Cucumber Coverage:**  
  `coverage/cucumber/index.html`  
  Line Coverage: **86.29% (428 / 496)**

## Use of AI Tools

In addition to using class material and feedback from our TA, we consulted AI tools for high-level guidance, including understanding Rails conventions, framework best practices, and debugging. We also used AI tools for code suggestions when developing portions of the codebase. All suggestions were reviewed, adapted, and integrated by our team.
